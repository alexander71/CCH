#About the Consortium

#Locations of CCH California Participants
#The Consortium of California Herbaria serves as a gateway to information from California vascular plant specimens that are housed in 
#participant herbaria. Records from the California Floristic Province portion of Baja California, Mexico are also included. 
#The database includes over 2 million specimen records from 35 institutions, all searchable through a single interface. 
#Originally developed in 2003 around botanical collections from University of California herbaria, the Consortium continues to grow as 
#more collections are added.

#The data included in this database represent an extract of the California vascular plant collections at participating institutions. 
#These data are updated regularly. Some of the partner institutions also serve their specimen data through an independent portal. 
#Links to participant webpages are available from the participant directory. 
#Some participating herbaria have collections of fungi, lichens, and bryophytes; those specimens are not included here. 
#The holdings of the participant herbaria are listed in a bar graph and a chart.
