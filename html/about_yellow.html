In recent years, many California herbaria have been actively digitizing their collections. This effort has resulted in the inclusion of over 2 million specimen records in the Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH), sixty-five percent of which are georeferenced (provided with geographic coordinates). This amazing accomplishment has made herbarium data available to a broad array of researchers including those studying climate change and developing conservation plans.
<P class='bodyLargerText'>
When seeking to understand a taxon's range, we now have the ability to computationally combine two lines of evidence, the description of the taxon's range provided in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> and the distribution of georeferenced specimens in the CCH that bear that taxon's name (and known nomenclatural synonyms). 
<P class='bodyLargerText'>
When mapped, most georeferenced specimens in the CCH fall within the taxon range described in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i>.  However, about 6% of them show incongruence &mdash; the georeferenced location for a specimen falls outside of the distributional range of the taxon as it is described in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i>. These records are tagged (in both the CCH and <i>Jepson eFlora</i>) with a "yellow flag."
<P class='bodyLargerText'>
We invite all botanists to join the effort to help resolve these incongruences. We are especially interested in recruiting field botanists with first-hand knowledge of plant distributions and herbarium botanists with collections that can help resolve questions about a taxon's distribution. Resolving "yellow flags" will forward two goals: (1) making herbarium data as accurate as possible and (2) using georeferenced voucher specimens to improve the description of taxon ranges included in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i>.
<P class='bodyLargerText'>
There are several reasons that specimen coordinates might be at variance with the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> including: the need to revise range statements in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i>, incorrect coordinates assigned to specimens, misidentifications or unincorporated taxonomic revisions, and technical mapping issues.

<P class='bodyLargerText'>For example, consider the taxon <i>Xylococcus bicolor</i>. In the original printing of <i>The Jepson Manual, Second Edition</i>, <i>X. bicolor</i> did not have the Peninsular Ranges Subregion (PR) indicated as part of its range, but yellow flag analysis revealed a large number of <i>X. bicolor</i> specimens collected from PR (left image). The yellow flagged records were resolved, in large part, by author confirmation to add PR to the distribution string of <i>X. bicolor</i> in the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> (right image). The addition of PR was based on the confirmation of specimens at UC/JEPS and RSA.

<!--<P class='bodyLargerText'>For example, consider the taxon <i>Calamagrostis breweri</i>. According to the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> treatment for <i>C. breweri</i> it occurs in the Klamath Ranges and northern High Sierra Nevada, but the CCH shows several "yellow flagged" specimens appear in the central and southern High Sierra Nevada.

</center>
<P class='bodyLargerText'>What is highly likely is that the flagged specimens are in fact <i>Calamagrostis muiriana</i>. The taxon <i>C. breweri</i> was split into <i>C. breweri</i> and <i>C. muiriana</i> in 2002, each with a distinct range. However, many herbarium specimens have not yet been annotated to reflect the taxonomic change, and still bear the name <i>C. breweri</i>, and ought to be updated.

<!--
<P class='bodyLargerText'>For example, consider the taxon <i>Salvia mohavensis</i>. According to the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> treatment for <i>S. mohavensis</i>, it occurs in DMtns (Desert Mountains) and DSon (Sonoran Desert). However, when a map of CCH specimens of <i>S. mohavensis</i> is generated, the majority of specimens are distributed throughout the eastern Mojave Desert. In this case the CCH data are not erroneous; the <i>Jepson eFlora</i> distribution string must be updated to include DMoj.

Yellow flags may also be generated for other reasons:
<DL>
<DT><b>Incorrect coordinates</b><DD>Latitude or longitude might be incorrectly recorded, converted, or transcribed. The location of the record might have been recorded incorrectly or inferred erroneously. These can often be corrected by examining the data without looking at a specimen.
<DT> <b>Mapping errors or other software errors</b> <DD>Very small region units such as  pieces of DMtns or offsh
ore islets were not
represented well by the process and consequently result in false positives. Records with locations close to boundaries are troublesome.
<DT> <b>Misidentification or other naming issues</b><DD>The specimen might have been incorrectly keyed out or mismatched with a picture initially, or there might have been a taxonomic revision subsequent to the initial identification. Assessing the possibility of misidentification will usually involve examination of specimens. It will be dangerous in most cases to make inferences based on record data alone.

<P class='bodyLargerText'>
If you would like to help investigate and resolve yellow flags, we welcome your input. In some cases, it is difficult to make inferences based on record data alone; specimens (at any herbarium) may need to be consulted. Please contact Staci Markos (<a href="mailto:smarkos@berkeley.edu">smarkos@berkeley.edu</a>) to get involved or send comments on particular taxa. Comments regarding individual specimens may also be submitted directly through the CCH portal.
