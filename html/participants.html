The small herbarium contains approximately 700 vascular plant specimens and over 300 bryophyte and lichen specimens dating from the early 1990s. The collection covers all the lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management Arcata Field Office in California, as well as other nearby public lands. Nearly all of the specimens were collected in Humboldt, Mendocino, or Trinity Counties. The collection includes some endangered and listed species as well as some potential range extensions and other species of interest.

	Founded in 1922, the Herbarium of the California Department of 
    Food and Agriculture serves as a plant identification service for 
    California state agencies, in particular the Department of Food and 
    Agriculture.  This includes invasive and horticultural plant 
    identification and evaluation, identification of hosts for insects, 
    plant pathogens and nematodes, as well as seed purity and viability 
    certification programs.  The collection focuses on those taxa that 
    best support the diagnostic mission of our facility.  This includes 
    a large seed herbarium, general California weeds and native plants 
    (particularly those that may occupy disturbed or agricultural 
    areas), invasive pest plants from inside and outside of California 
    and the U.S. (as well as their close relatives), plants from other 
    areas with a Mediterranean climate, cultivated plants and their wild 
    forms, specialty horticultural species, and general agricultural 
    crops. Size of collection: 40,000 plus 40,000 seed accessions. 
    Approximately 75% of the collection consists of native and 
    naturalized plants of California. Notable collections include those 
    of T. C. Fuller, B. Crampton (seeds), M. Ballou, G. F. Hrusa, and D. G. Kelch. </td>

The herbarium is especially rich in Asteraceae.  Approximately 80 percent of the specimens are from California, particularly central coastal counties.  Most of the out-of-state collections are from the southwestern US and Mexico.  Notable collections include those of Robert F. Hoover, David J. Keil, D. R.

Louise Baartz was a former biology professor at Victor Valley College who began an herbarium collection under the supervision of Dr. Wilbur Mayhew of the University of California at Riverside.  In 1973 she registered the Victor Valley College herbarium collection, then with only around 300 specimens, with the California Department of Agriculture. The collection now contains 5,000+ (2,000+ accessioned and georeferenced) specimens from the Mojave Desert, San Bernardino Mountains, the southeastern Sierra Nevada, southern San Joaquin Valley, and southeastern Arizona.

<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">YM. 
	YM is a significant regional collection, with 8,000 specimens, dating from the early part of the 20th century to the present with the bulk of specimens dating from the 1920s to the 1960s. This is an actively growing herbarium, with over 3,000 vascular plant specimens added in the last ten years.  The herbarium is a valuable component of the park's museum collections and is an essential tool for resource management: fire management, exotics programs, and vegetation management. It is also a valuable source of information to the scientific community about Yosemite's complex flora.  Access to the collections is granted to researchers by advance appointment.</td>
